### Building from source

mir2x requires [cmake](https://cmake.org/) v3+ and [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) support c++14 to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/etorth/mir2x.git
$ cd mir2x
$ mkdir b
$ cd b
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

### Code style

global variables:

1. don't use global of build-in type or struct since no multithread control.
2. don't use global of class instanse since confusing construction/distruction.

actually:

1. only use class pointer;
2. only reference it by ``extern g_VarXXX";
3. no local function for operation on global variable only, means:
4. all operations over global variables should be self-contained;
5. all global variable pointers stay valid during the whole procedure;

Since I already have a powerful log system, I won't use exception. If un-recoverable error happens

1. log system record the detailed info by LOGTYPE_FATAL;
2. then just let it crash, or use exit(0) to do forced kill;

The function who throws always think it's a fatal error so it just throw, but how to handle this ``fatal" error or do catch sub-clause really takes it as fatal is decided not by the thrower, but the catcher.

For modules like mapeditor which doesn't have a log system, always put assertion to check parameters. If functions invoked with invalid parameters, fail assertion and let it crash.

General rules for functions:

1. put strict parameters check above doing actual logic;
2. take invalid argument as severe error, just log the error and let it crash;
3. never give assumption for argument;
4. try best to make each memeber function self-contained to avoid first-half / second-half splitted functions;

General rules for classes:

1. an object should be in legal state when created, by factory method or constructor;
2. an object should stay valid if no input provided;
3. put strict parameters check when provide input to objects, and reject immedately if not valid;
4. avoid to do state validation outside an object;
5. external call of member function should never break current object, keep log instead;
